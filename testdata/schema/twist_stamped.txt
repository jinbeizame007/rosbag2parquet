# This expresses velocity in free space broken into its linear and angular parts.

Vector3  linear

# This represents a vector in free space.

# This is semantically different than a point.
# A vector is always anchored at the origin.
# When a transform is applied to a vector, only the rotational component is applied.

# Standard metadata for higher-level stamped data types.
# This is generally used to communicate timestamped data
# in a particular coordinate frame.

# Two-integer timestamp that is expressed as seconds and nanoseconds.

# The seconds component, valid over all int32 values.
int32 sec

# The nanoseconds component, valid in the range [0, 10e9).
